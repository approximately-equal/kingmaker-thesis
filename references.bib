% core theory ==================================================================

% Axioms:
% 1. Unrestricted domain:  The social welfare function is defined for every admissible pair of individual orderings i.e. all possible voting preferences are possible, so in ranked choice election with A, B, C, all configurations of A, B, C are possible (e.g., A < B < C)
% 2. Pareto Efficiency: If all voters prefer A < B then A < B overall
% 3. Non-dictatorship: The system does not depend on only one voter's ballot.
% 4. Independence of irrelevant alternatives: A voters preferences of (A, B) depend only on A and B, and not whether A < C or C < A (as we'll see later, this is a very important, and _very_ contentios axiom).
%
% Arrows theorom that all of these axioms cannot be satisfied all at once
% Limitations: Arrow's theorem only applies to rankings with 3+ options.
%
% Def of _social welfare function: A function that aggregates voter preferences into a single society-wide prefencence, called a preference profile.

% The famous Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem: All non-dictatorial (arrow's theorem) voting systems that are non-trivial (at least 2 candidates) are manipulable i.e. there is some method of casting votes contrary to a voters true preferences such that the serure an outcome according their preferences (despite not having accurately reported as such).
%
% Corollary: Every voting system with at least three outcoms is either dictatorial or manipulable.
%
% Def of _game forms_: any scheme which makes anoutcome depend on individual actions of some specified sort (a _strategy_)
%
% Def of _dominant strategy_: A strategy is dominant if, regardless of the choices of other players, the strategy achieves the specified goal at least as good as any alternative strategy.

In addition, if a three-way meet is scored as three dual meets, the scoring method can produce a cycle, thereby violating the principle of Transitivity: team A beats team B, team B beats team C, but team C beats team A. Real-world violations of Independ̀ence and Transitivity are reported from a high school cross-country meet held in Michigan in the U.S. in 2003. Several results are presented about the conditions under which these two principles can be violated. An alternative scoring method that will violate neither Independence nor Transitivity is also discussed and evaluated.},

The voting procedure is strategy-proof if it always induces every committee member to cast a ballot revealing his preference. I prove three theorems. First, every strategy-proof voting procedure is dictatorial. Second, this paper's strategy-proofness condition for voting procedures corresponds to Arrow's rationality, independence of irrelevant alternatives, non-negative response, and citizens' sovereignty conditions for social welfare functions. Third, Arrow's general possibility theorem is proven in a new manner.}
