= Introduction <intro>

In this section, I'll introduce the premise of the thesis. I will begin by describing how is in the field of social choice theory. Then I will introduce the idea of strategic voting, and the premises of the paper. Lastly, I will briefly discuss the methods of the thesis: this is a simulation study, where fabricated data will be used to judge and verify the efficacy of strategic voting strategies and the resilience of voting methods against them.

This section must introduce the thesis questions and provide a hook (perhaps some surprising results) that hook the reader and informs them why this matters.
