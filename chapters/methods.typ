	Methods
] <methods>

This chapter should begin by restating the thesis questions, and explaining the overarching framework by which we aim to answer them. Mainly, via monte-carlo and simulation. It should explain that in the results section, we will:

  + Train computational models to "optimally vote"
  + Test those models (and more well-know ones) to find the best of the best
  + Test how manipulable various `methods` are
  + Determine which social conditions are most / least favorable for strategic voting
  + etc...

== A Theory of Voting
In this section, we discuss how (and why) `Kingmaker` is set up the way it is, and the ways that this architecture will impact the way that simulations are run and results collected. The point of this section is to get the reader comfortable with the `Synthesizer` $->$ `Strategy` $->$ `Method` voting process.

== Hyper-parameters
This section should describe the bounds of our analysis. It should specify which combinations of (`Synthesizer`, `Method`, `Strategy`, `SocialConditions`) we will be simulating.

== etc...
There is more that needs to be added here
