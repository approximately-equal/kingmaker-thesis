== Review
In this section, we tie everything together, reviewing the work that has been done. What are the most important results? What have we build conceptually?

Having completed analyzing the results, take the time to reflect on how well the results have followed the guidelines laid out in the methods section. What is the efficacy of these methods and our approach to simulation and analysis.

== Introspection & Conclusion
This section is where the thesis winds down. It should step back and to consider the entire project as a whole. It should re-evaluate the thesis questions and the work that's been done. Have we succeeded in answering them?

Additionally, this section should swing back around to social choice to ask how this fits (or doesn't) with the existing literature. What have we gained by doing this analysis?

== Future Research
This section discusses potential future research that follows from this work. In general, this falls into 3 buckets:
  1. What is missing from the analysis that further analysis can fill in?
  2. What are some conclusions that open new paths for further exploration?
  3. What might be redone / expanded on to help clarify or revise any findings?
