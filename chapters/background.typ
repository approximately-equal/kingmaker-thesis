== Election Systems

=== Axioms:
+ What properties do what we care about in a voting system? What is the social welfare fuction?

=== Social Choice Theorems:
+ Arrow, Gibbard-Satterwaite


=== What are the options:
+ Explain the voting systems that are in use, along with some that might be better alternatives.


== How Voters Vote?
  + Honest (Non-stochastic)
  + Stochastic (noisy) like the plackett-luce and mallows models

== Preferences $->$ Ballots
  + What do we know about how voters turn their preferences into ballots?
  + What are historical models for voter behavior, and what are their merits?
  + How will we model voter behavior in this thesis?
  + What is the difference between a preference and a ballot?

== Strategic Voting
===
  + Why do people strategically vote, and historically how have they done so?
  + What are known strategic voting methods? What flaws allow for each kind strategic voting strategy?
  + When have they influenced the outcome of elections?

===
+ What properties (research) does optimal strategic voting functions have?
+ How will we, specifically, model strategic voting?
+ What does it mean for a strategic voting function to be "optimal"?


// The field of _social choice theory_<sct> has been around for quite a while, and in its history many significant discoveries have been made. Among the most important have been _Arrow's Impossibility Theorem_ @arrows-theorem and the _Gibbard-Satterthwiate Theorem_ @gibbard-satterthwaite-theorem.

// Of particular interest is this _Gibbard-Satterthwiate Theorem_, which proves that _all_ non-trivial (more than )
