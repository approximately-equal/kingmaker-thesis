== Election Methods
Elections of some kind have existed forever. In ancient civilizations there has always been a form of elections, from dictatorial to oligarhical to consensus. The best-known ancient civilization that had voted by consensus had to be Athens, which voted by democracy, though its worth noting that democracy included only free adult men. Additionally, it is not remotely the first such democracy, not only in greece, but in general. There is evidence of many older civilizations which voted by consensus.

All of this to point out that the modern underpinnings of voting have existed for a long time almost unchanged. Pluracracy as a voting method has existed for thousands of years. If anything, the modern revolution of voting has been in increased representation.

What this brief history tells us is that while the purpose of voting is to make (collective) decisions via some sort of procedure, what characteristics of the procedure, as well as the social conditions that surround it vastly impact its outcomes.

=== Social Welfare
This brings us to the _social welfare function_, denoted $cal(W)(v)$. The social welfare function is a measure of a voter $v$'s "happiness" at a particular outcome or result. The goal of any voting method is to maximize social welfare for a given collection of preferences through some deterministic process which is _not_ dependent of the preferecences of the voters.

// #sidenote[Though who's welfare is taken into account is a question that needs to be considered when considering any election conditions past or present]

Generally we'll take the social welfare function to be the sum of the welfare over all voters, where all voters is representative of the entire population.

So we have some abstract metric that can tell us how well
