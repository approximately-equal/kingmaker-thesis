+ Discuss / introduce the methods that will be used to judge the manipulability of a voting system
+ Discuss / introduce the methods that will be used to judge effectiveness of a strategy.

== Optimization
Start broad. For each category `Cardinal`, `Ordinal`, `Nominal`, `...?` what are some general principles. Which methods are done in practice? Why do they work?

For each computational strategy, explain:
+ What general algorithm it is
+ What it does / how it works conceptually
+ How is is implemented, / what are the hyperparameters

Test it with various strategies. How did it perform?

Compare these results to

== Method Analysis
Compare each of the voting systems across a broad range of social conditions and `Synthesizers` using the various metrics for judging manipulability. Show some ridge plots that compare the methods?

Analyze which ones generally performed well across all tests?

Which voting methods had stregths and weaknesses?
