  In the field of social choice theory, The Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem tells us that any all non-trivial, non-dictatorial voting methods do _not_ have a dominant strategy for any individual voter. Thus every voting system which follows these axioms (which they should) must be manipulable. Thus any voting method must consider how voters will strategically vote in order to benefit their social welfare.

  There have been efforts such as #highlight[...] that aim to measure how resilient a voting method is to certain kinds of strategic voting, but #highlight[...]

  My thesis expands upon this literature by simulating complex social conditions
  in order to:

  1. Synthesize optimal (in some measurable sense) strategies for some voter block,
  2. Use those novel (as well as known) voting strategies to compare the resilience of common voting methods, and
  3. #highlight[...]
