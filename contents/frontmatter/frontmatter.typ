#frontmatter.abstract[
  The Gibbardâ€“Satterthwaite Theorem establishes that any non-dictatorial voting rule with at least three alternatives is inherently vulnerable to strategic manipulation. This work examines the practical consequences of this theorem by analyzing the susceptibility of various voting methods under a range of social conditions and models of voter behavior. To support this analysis, a modular and performant simulation framework---`kingmaker`---is developed for modeling elections across diverse strategic environments and preference distributions. Using `kingmaker`, this work offers a systematic evaluation of the frequency, impact, and structure of strategic voting across multiple electoral systems. The results yield empirical insight into the robustness of these systems and identify the conditions under which theoretical manipulability becomes operationally significant.
