= Introduction <intro>

In every election, voters face the challenge of casting their ballots in a way that maximizes their influence on the outcome. However, there is actually no such strategy that works for all situations. The reason for this is the Gibbardâ€“Satterthwaite Theorem, which proves that any non-dictatorial voting rule with at least three alternatives is inherently vulnerable to strategic manipulation. This landmark result shows that all (reasonable) voting methods are susceptible to exploitation, leaving open the question of how often this vulnerability leads to practical problems in real-world elections.

While the theorem establishes the theoretical inevitability of strategic behavior, it says nothing about when its practically significant and to what extend strategic manipulation is possible. How frequently does strategic voting occur? What impact does it have on election outcomes? And under what conditions does theoretical manipulability become practically significant?

To investigate these issues, I have developed a modular and efficient simulation framework---`kingmaker`---designed to model elections across diverse strategic environments and preference distributions. By simulating elections under different scenarios, this research provides empirical insights into the frequency, impact, and structure of strategic voting, as well as offering a deeper understanding of the robustness of various electoral systems.

The following chapters present the theoretical background behind strategic manipulation, a detailed description of the `kingmaker` framework, empirical results from simulations, and a discussion of the implications for electoral design and reform.
