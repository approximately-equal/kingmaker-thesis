One of the goals of this research, which unfortunately had to be cut due to time constraints, is to synthesize an _optimal_ strategy for a given understanding of the social conditions around an election. Future research could use `kingmaker` to simulate different strategies and compare their performance. There are many ways to go about this, including: nash equilibrium, genetic algorithms, neural networks, and reinforcement learning.
